- Urban flooding poses increasing risks due to climate change, requiring accurate and scalable detection methods.

- We propose a 3D simulation-based synthetic dataset generation pipeline to overcome real-world data limitations.

- Combined with HITL-refined real data, our method improves flood detection model performance and generalization.

- The approach supports disaster response, smart city monitoring, and is extendable to other environmental scenarios.
